# Malware-detection-using-deep-learning
This is a repository for beginnners in deep learning . Here I have created a malware detection model using obfuscated dataset taken from Canadian University for Cybersecurity in which the data is equally divided into Malacious and benign files. 
The file malware_main.py contains the code using tensorflow for deep learning .
The file malware_gui.py consist the code for creating a GUI interface to make it look more attractive and presentable.
For accessing the Obfuscated dataset you can go to this link->https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/malmem-2022.html
Thankyou
